### MeshFlow Video Denoising (Dec. 2016 – May. 2017)
* Implemented an efficient and robust video denoising method.
* Utilized mesh-flow for motion estimation.
* Proposed a novel method for fast dense motion field estimation.

### Shape Recovery of Endoscopic Videos by Shape from Shading(SfS) using Mesh Regularization (Oct. 2015 – Jul. 2016)
* Presented a method to recover the inner-surface's shape of organs from endoscopic videos.
* Employed SFS for estimating a first 3D representation.
* Used a mesh least-squares regularization for constrain.
* Employed a spatial-temporal approach for smoothing of consecutive frames.

### Signal Analysis of Sound Produced by Collision of Steal Balls (Sep. 2014 – Jan. 2015)
* Quantified the frequent modulation characteristic.
* Explained the source of the chirping.
* Matched with the practical case both in the wave form and the sound effect.
